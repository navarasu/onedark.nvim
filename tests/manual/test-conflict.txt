# Git Conflict Test File - onedark.nvim
# Tests git conflict marker highlighting (fix #235)

This file simulates a git merge conflict.
The conflict markers should have colored backgrounds:
- GREEN for HEAD/current changes (GitConflictCurrent/CurrentLabel)
- BLUE for incoming changes (GitConflictIncoming/IncomingLabel)
- PURPLE for ancestor/common changes (GitConflictAncestor/AncestorLabel)

Normal content before conflict

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the current branch content (should have GREEN background)
This line is from HEAD
Another line from the current branch
||||||| merged common ancestors
This is the common ancestor content (should have PURPLE background)
This was in the original version
=======
This is the incoming branch content (should have BLUE background)
This line is from the incoming branch
Another line from the feature branch
>>>>>>> feature-branch

Normal content after conflict

Here's another conflict example:

<<<<<<< HEAD
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}
=======
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.map(i => i.price).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
>>>>>>> refactor-calculate

End of conflict test file.

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Open this file with: nvim -u tests/test-init.lua tests/manual/test-conflict.txt
2. Conflict markers (<<<<<<, ||||||, =======, >>>>>>>) should be BOLD
3. Content sections should have colored backgrounds:
   - HEAD section: Green tint
   - Incoming section: Blue tint
   - Ancestor section (if present): Purple tint
